 # Introduction
In this data-driven technological era, there is an abundance of data readily accessible to all with the help of search engines. However, users, especially researchers and such may face hurdle to get specific results for their need with the overwhelming amount of data available. This is where RE-SEARCH, a cluster-based search application comes in to play as its main purpose is to let its users to search in their custom-made clusters of links with the type of files the users are looking for. Re-search is designed to make searching very specific for its users. Users will be able to set their own clusters of links and will be able to define search methods based on textual file types such as: pdf, txt, doc etc. Users then will be able to search for keywords within the clusters to get intended results. The software serves to make researching easier for its users as other conventional search engines can often provide overwhelming number of results or data that can make the research very cumbersome.

# Aims & Goals
1. User friendly interface on the frontend which would boost up RE-SEARCH and make searching easier and faster.<br>
2. The users are in charge here, and set their own parameters and search for their desired content. No redundant results which might waste the user’s time.<br>
3. One of the primary goals of our project is to provide a safe, secured search experience. We do not use or make profit by selling any of the user’s data secretively or deceptively, and only require just their e-mail IDs and a password to register or to login via their other social accounts.<br>
4. RE-SEARCH makes searching accurate and easy for its users with no strings attached. Users can find whatever they are looking for with ease and its even enjoyable to use.<br>
The web application RE-SEARCH would also aim to fulfill other quality attributes such as:
   <b>Availability:</b> This software will be available to use at all times for its users as the data would be indexed in a 3rd party service, Elasticsearch and would also provide search functionalities. Temporary unavailability may happen for scheduled maintenance.<br>
   <b>Correctness:</b> This software will provide accurate results based on the links the users provide in clusters and the keywords they will use when they need to search.<br>
   <b>Reusability:</b> The users will be able to reuse and search many times on the clusters that they create.<br>

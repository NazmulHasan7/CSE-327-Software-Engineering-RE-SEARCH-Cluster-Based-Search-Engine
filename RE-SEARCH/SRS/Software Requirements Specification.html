                    <p>
                        In this data-driven technological era, there is an abundance of data readily accessible to all
                        with the
                        help of search engines. But users, especially researchers and such may face hurdle to get
                        specific
                        results for their need with the overwhelming amount of data available. This is where Search
                        Cluster, a
                        cluster-based search application comes in to play as its main purpose is to let its users to
                        search in
                        their custom-made clusters of links with the type of files the users are looking for. This
                        document
                        serves to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the software Re-search,
                        the
                        details of its features and functionalities, and the constrains it must run under. This document
                        is made
                        for version 1.0 of the software.

                        who intend to use the software and the document would be a very helpful guide for them to start

                        the SRS covers all of the aspects of the software Re-search in six different sections in an
                        organized and sequential manner with little to no technical jargons. The readers are suggested
                        to go
                        through all of the sections to get a good grasp about the ins and outs of the software. The
                        first
                        section gives an introduction of the product, the second section deals with the descriptions
                        about its
                        functions, classes and such. The third section illustrates all of the external interface
                        requirements,
                        fourth section talks about the software's features. Fifth and Sixth sections deal with various
                        other
                        requirements.

                    <p>Re-search is designed to make searching very specific for its users. Users will be able to
                        set their
                        own clusters of links and will be able to define search methods based on textual file types such
                        as:
                        pdf, txt, doc etc. Users then will be able to search for keywords within the clusters to get
                        intended
                        results. The software serves to make researching easier for its users as other conventional
                        search
                        engines can often provide overwhelming number of results or data that can make the research very

                            The Re-search application will use standard HTTP protocol communication. Sign up
                            authentication will be done via
                            email. After creating a Search cluster the user have to wait until the system crawls data
                            from user’s preferred websites.
                            The system will notify the user via email once it becomes ready to perform search operation.
                            All these will be done
                            through HTTP requests.

                            <li><strong>Data Crawling Ethics: </strong>Repeated requests of the web pages can slow down
                                the webserver. Sometimes aggressive
                                scraping may lead to functional issues for the website. Besides, websites may contain
                                materials with copyright claims.
                                Making copies of those copyright materials is considered as an illegal activity. So, web
                                crawling should be done at a disruptive
                                rate by maintaining website's terms and conditions so that it does not slow down the
                                website and hamper it's regular activities.<br>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Fair usage policy: </strong> Web scraping and crawling is not illegal unless it
                                is done
                                in an unethical way. Scraping private informations from website and exposing it publicly
                                falls under
                                illegal activity. Scrapped data should not be used for commercial purposes. <br>

                            <li><strong>API: </strong>Application Programming Interface (API) provides an interface
                                between two pieces of software to
                                communicate. API allows an application to access data and interact with external
                                components of the software.<br>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Framework: </strong>Framework is used as a foundation for application
                                developments. It allows application
                                developers to develop new features in a well-structured manner. Framework provides
                                generic functionality that can be
                                changed to use for specific purposes.<br>
